# Privacy policy | Hazumi
Last updated: October 19, 2025

## Information we collect
Hazumi does not collect any information about you. App data, such as crash logs, may be sent to your application store provider (App Store, Play Store) which we use to fix issues with performance or functionality.

## Your privacy
Hazumi protects your privacy by only communicating with a privately owned content server `hazumi.news`.
To protect your privacy from websites shared on Hacker News, the app securely communicates with this content server to fetch glanceable summaries and primary image from the linked website. We serve image content directly through our custom CDN `cdn.hazumi.news`. These efforts ensure your network traffic never appears on 3rd party websites unless you decide to visit the article via the "Visit ariticle" button in app, you will then be subjected to the linked website's privacy policy.

## Your consent
By using the app or website, you consent to this privacy policy.

## Contact us
If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, please email us at support@zumistudios.com
