## Information we collect
Hazumi does not collect any information about you. App data, such as crash logs may be sent to Apple which we will use to fix any bugs that may arise.

## Your privacy
Hazumi protects your privacy by only communicating with a privately owned proxy server `www.hazumi.news`. 
This server stores cached content from Hacker News via the Hacker News API and content from 3rd party websites such as images. 
This ensures your data never leaks to 3rd party websites.
However, if you explicitly navigate to any linked website via the "Visit ariticle" button in app, you will then be subjected to their privacy policy.

## Your consent
By using the app or website, you consent to this privacy policy.
